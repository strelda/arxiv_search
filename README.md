# arxiv_search
Rust script for searching Arxiv articles and printing the relevant summary.
This is standalone project, which will be implemented in the future into one super app. 
# setup
- write the query according to the official [Arxiv API documentation](https://arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual#query_details)
- set if you want only articles from today

# run
after changing the query, compile (`cargo run`) again (this will be changed in the future) and run
