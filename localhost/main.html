  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Predicting Topological Quantum Phase Transition via Multipartite
  Entanglement from Dynamics</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Sudip Kumar Haldar, Aditi Sen De</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-26T18:42:05Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  An exactly solvable Kitaev model in a two-dimensional square lattice exhibits
a topological quantum phase transition which is different from the
symmetry-breaking transition at zero temperature. When the ground state of a
non-linearly perturbed Kitaev model with different strengths of perturbation
taken as the initial state is quenched to a pure Kitaev model, we demonstrate
that various features of the dynamical state, such as Loschmidt echo,
time-averaged multipartite entanglement, can determine whether the initial
state belongs to the topological phase or not. Moreover, the derivatives of the
quantifiers can faithfully identify the topological quantum phase transition,
present in equilibrium. When the individual qubits of the lattice interact with
the local thermal bath repeatedly, we observe that block entanglement can
nevertheless distinguish the phases from which the system starts evolution.

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Photonic qubits should be controllable on-chip and noise-tolerant when
transmitted over optical networks for practical applications. Furthermore,
qubit sources should be programmable and have high brightness to be useful for
quantum algorithms and grant resilience to losses. However, widespread encoding
schemes only combine at most two of these properties. Here, we overcome this
hurdle by demonstrating a programmable silicon nano-photonic chip generating
frequency-bin entangled photons, an encoding scheme compatible with long-range
transmission over optical links. The emitted quantum states can be manipulated
using existing telecommunication components, including active devices that can
be integrated in silicon photonics. As a demonstration, we show our chip can be
programmed to generate the four computational basis states, and the four
maximally-entangled Bell states, of a two-qubits system. Our device combines
all the key-properties of on-chip state reconfigurability and dense
integration, while ensuring high brightness, fidelity, and purity.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Optimal design of nanomagnets for on-chip field gradients</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By William Legrand, Sandrine Lopes, Quentin Schaeverbeke, François Montaigne, Matthieu M. Desjardins</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-26T13:29:28Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The generation of localized magnetic field gradients by on-chip nanomagnets
is important for a variety of technological applications, in particular for
spin qubits. To advance beyond the empirical design of these nanomagnets, we
propose a systematic and general approach based on the micromagnetic
formulation of an optimal field gradient source. We study the different field
configurations that can be realized and find out quantitatively the most
suitable ferromagnetic layer geometries. Using micromagnetic simulations, we
then investigate the minimum requirements for reaching magnetic saturation in
these nanomagnets. In terms of either longitudinal or transverse field
gradient, the results provide an optimal solution for uniform, saturated
nanomagnets, where the magnetic material can be selected according to the
strength of the external fields that can be used.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Le Tuan Anh Ho, Liviu Ungur, Liviu F. Chibotaru</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-26T11:24:17Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We examine the coherence/incoherence transition temperature of a generic
molecular spin. Our results demonstrates that a molecular spin with a high
coherence/incoherence transition temperature should possess a low spin number
and low axiality, or high spin number and high axiality. Interestingly, the
latter is better protected from the magnetic noises than the former and thus be
the best candidate for a robust electron-based molecular spin qubit/qudit. The
transition temperature can be further optimized if a large non-axial component
of the spin Hamiltonian exists.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Simulation of Networked Quantum Computing on Encrypted Data</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Ieva Čepaitė</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-25T20:02:53Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Due to the limited availability of quantum computing power in the near
future, cryptographic security techniques must be developed for secure remote
use of current and future quantum computing hardware. Prominent among these is
Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) and its variations such as Quantum
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (QFHE), which herald interactive and remote secure
quantum computing power becoming available to parties that require little more
than the ability to prepare and measure single qubits. Here I present a
simulation of such a protocol, tested classically on the simulation platform
LIQ$Ui|\rangle$ and then later adapted to and run on the recently released IBM
16-qubit quantum chip using their beta cloud service. It demonstrates the
functionality of the protocol and explores the effects of noise on potential
physical systems that would be used to implement it.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Near-optimal Circuit construction via Cartan decomposition</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Maximilian Balthasar Mansky, Santiago Londoño Castillo, Victor Ramos Puigvert, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-25T17:01:13Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We show the applicability of the Cartan decomposition of Lie algebras to
Quantum Circuits. This approach can be used to synthesize circuits that can
efficiently reach any desired unitary operation. Our method finds explicit
quantum circuit representations of the algebraic generators of the relevant Lie
algebras allowing the direct implementation of a Cartan decomposition on a
quantum computer. The construction is recursive and allows us to expand any
circuit down to generators and rotation matrices on individual qubits, where
through our recursive algorithm we find that the generators themselves can be
expressed with CNOT and SWAP gates explicitly. Our approach is independent of
the standard CNOT implementation and can be easily adapted to other cross-qubit
circuit elements. In addition to its versatility, we also achieve near-optimal
counts when working with CNOT gates, achieving an asymptotic CNOT cost of
$\frac{23}{24}4n$ for $n$ qubits.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>A Quantum Information Theoretic View On A Deep Quantum Neural Network</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Beatrix C. Hiesmayr</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-25T14:00:49Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We discuss a quantum version of an artificial deep neural network where the
role of neurons is taken over by qubits and the role of weights is played by
unitaries. The role of the non-linear activation function is taken over by
subsequently tracing out layers (qubits) of the network. We study two examples
and discuss the learning from a quantum information theoretic point of view. In
detail, we show that the lower bound of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations is
defining the change of the gradient descent in the learning process. We raise
the question if the limit by Nature to two non-commuting observables,
quantified in the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, is ruling the optimization
of the quantum deep neural network. We find a negative answer.
