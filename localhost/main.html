  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Predicting Topological Quantum Phase Transition via Multipartite
  Entanglement from Dynamics</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Leela Ganesh Chandra Lakkaraju, Sudip Kumar Haldar, Aditi Sen De</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-26T18:42:05Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  An exactly solvable Kitaev model in a two-dimensional square lattice exhibits
a topological quantum phase transition which is different from the
symmetry-breaking transition at zero temperature. When the ground state of a
non-linearly perturbed Kitaev model with different strengths of perturbation
taken as the initial state is quenched to a pure Kitaev model, we demonstrate
that various features of the dynamical state, such as Loschmidt echo,
time-averaged multipartite entanglement, can determine whether the initial
state belongs to the topological phase or not. Moreover, the derivatives of the
quantifiers can faithfully identify the topological quantum phase transition,
present in equilibrium. When the individual qubits of the lattice interact with
the local thermal bath repeatedly, we observe that block entanglement can
nevertheless distinguish the phases from which the system starts evolution.

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Photonic qubits should be controllable on-chip and noise-tolerant when
transmitted over optical networks for practical applications. Furthermore,
qubit sources should be programmable and have high brightness to be useful for
quantum algorithms and grant resilience to losses. However, widespread encoding
schemes only combine at most two of these properties. Here, we overcome this
hurdle by demonstrating a programmable silicon nano-photonic chip generating
frequency-bin entangled photons, an encoding scheme compatible with long-range
transmission over optical links. The emitted quantum states can be manipulated
using existing telecommunication components, including active devices that can
be integrated in silicon photonics. As a demonstration, we show our chip can be
programmed to generate the four computational basis states, and the four
maximally-entangled Bell states, of a two-qubits system. Our device combines
all the key-properties of on-chip state reconfigurability and dense
integration, while ensuring high brightness, fidelity, and purity.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-26T13:29:28Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The generation of localized magnetic field gradients by on-chip nanomagnets
is important for a variety of technological applications, in particular for
spin qubits. To advance beyond the empirical design of these nanomagnets, we
propose a systematic and general approach based on the micromagnetic
formulation of an optimal field gradient source. We study the different field
configurations that can be realized and find out quantitatively the most
suitable ferromagnetic layer geometries. Using micromagnetic simulations, we
then investigate the minimum requirements for reaching magnetic saturation in
these nanomagnets. In terms of either longitudinal or transverse field
gradient, the results provide an optimal solution for uniform, saturated
nanomagnets, where the magnetic material can be selected according to the
strength of the external fields that can be used.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-26T11:24:17Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We examine the coherence/incoherence transition temperature of a generic
molecular spin. Our results demonstrates that a molecular spin with a high
coherence/incoherence transition temperature should possess a low spin number
and low axiality, or high spin number and high axiality. Interestingly, the
latter is better protected from the magnetic noises than the former and thus be
the best candidate for a robust electron-based molecular spin qubit/qudit. The
transition temperature can be further optimized if a large non-axial component
of the spin Hamiltonian exists.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-25T20:02:53Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Due to the limited availability of quantum computing power in the near
future, cryptographic security techniques must be developed for secure remote
use of current and future quantum computing hardware. Prominent among these is
Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC) and its variations such as Quantum
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (QFHE), which herald interactive and remote secure
quantum computing power becoming available to parties that require little more
than the ability to prepare and measure single qubits. Here I present a
simulation of such a protocol, tested classically on the simulation platform
LIQ$Ui|\rangle$ and then later adapted to and run on the recently released IBM
16-qubit quantum chip using their beta cloud service. It demonstrates the
functionality of the protocol and explores the effects of noise on potential
physical systems that would be used to implement it.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-25T17:01:13Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We show the applicability of the Cartan decomposition of Lie algebras to
Quantum Circuits. This approach can be used to synthesize circuits that can
efficiently reach any desired unitary operation. Our method finds explicit
quantum circuit representations of the algebraic generators of the relevant Lie
algebras allowing the direct implementation of a Cartan decomposition on a
quantum computer. The construction is recursive and allows us to expand any
circuit down to generators and rotation matrices on individual qubits, where
through our recursive algorithm we find that the generators themselves can be
expressed with CNOT and SWAP gates explicitly. Our approach is independent of
the standard CNOT implementation and can be easily adapted to other cross-qubit
circuit elements. In addition to its versatility, we also achieve near-optimal
counts when working with CNOT gates, achieving an asymptotic CNOT cost of
$\frac{23}{24}4n$ for $n$ qubits.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-25T14:00:49Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We discuss a quantum version of an artificial deep neural network where the
role of neurons is taken over by qubits and the role of weights is played by
unitaries. The role of the non-linear activation function is taken over by
subsequently tracing out layers (qubits) of the network. We study two examples
and discuss the learning from a quantum information theoretic point of view. In
detail, we show that the lower bound of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations is
defining the change of the gradient descent in the learning process. We raise
the question if the limit by Nature to two non-commuting observables,
quantified in the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, is ruling the optimization
of the quantum deep neural network. We find a negative answer.

  qubit control and quantum sensing</h1>

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-24T23:00:12Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Spin defects in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) attract increasing interest for
quantum technology since they represent optically-addressable qubits in a van
der Waals material. In particular, negatively-charged boron vacancy centers
(${V_B}^-$) in hBN have shown promise as sensors of temperature, pressure, and
static magnetic fields. However, the short spin coherence time of this defect
currently limits its scope for quantum technology. Here, we apply dynamical
decoupling techniques to suppress magnetic noise and extend the spin coherence
time by nearly two orders of magnitude, approaching the fundamental $T_1$
relaxation limit. Based on this improvement, we demonstrate advanced spin
control and a set of quantum sensing protocols to detect electromagnetic
signals in the MHz range with sub-Hz resolution. This work lays the foundation
for nanoscale sensing using spin defects in an exfoliable material and opens a
promising path to quantum sensors and quantum networks integrated into
ultra-thin structures.

  entanglement-assisted packing processes</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Jun-Yi Wu, Kosuke Matsui, Tim Forrer, Akihito Soeda, Pablo Andrés-Martínez, Daniel Mills, Luciana Henaut, Mio Murao</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-24T08:45:44Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  In noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing, the scalability of a quantum
processor unit (QPU) is limited. The scalability of a single QPU can be
extended through distributed quantum computing (DQC), in which one can
implement global operations over two QPUs by entanglement-assisted local
operations and classical communication (LOCC). To facilitate this type of DQC
in experiments, we need an entanglement-efficient protocol. To this end, we
extend the standard protocol implementing each single controlled-unitary gate
with one maximally entangled pair [Eisert et. al., PRA, 62:052317(2000)] to a
new protocol based on entanglement-assisted packing processes, which can
implement multiple controlled-unitary gates using one maximally entangled pair.
In particular, two types of packing processes are introduced as the building
blocks of entanglement-efficient DQC, namely the distributing processes and
embedding processes. The efficiency of entanglement is enhanced by embedding
processes, which merge two non-sequential distributing processes and hence save
the entanglement cost. We show that the structure of distributability and
embeddability of a quantum circuit can be fully represented by packing graphs
and conflict graphs. Based on these graphs, we derive heuristic algorithms for
finding an entanglement-efficient packing of distributing processes for a given
quantum circuit to be implemented by two parties. These algorithms can
determine the required number of local auxiliary qubits in the DQC. One can
also set an upper limit on the local auxiliary qubits. We apply these
algorithms for bipartite DQC of unitary coupled-cluster circuits and find a
significant entanglement reduction through embeddings. This method can be
employed to determine a constructive upper bound on entanglement cost for a
quantum circuit approaching its lower bound.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Dafa Li, Maggie Cheng, Xiongrong Li, Shuwang Li</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-24T03:34:03Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 100507 (2010)], Borsten et al. derived 31
entanglement families of four qubits by using the black-hole vs. qubit
correspondence, which can be reduced to nine up to permutation of the four
qubits under stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC).
In this paper, we investigate the classification of "large" black holes by
using the local unitary operator (LU) entanglement classification of three
qubits. We relate the LU entanglement classes of the GHZ SLOCC class of three
qubits to different classes of "large" black holes. Thus, we partition "large"
black holes into seven inequivalent families. We show that between two black
holes with four non-vanishing charges $q_{0}$, $p^{1}$, $p^{2}$, and $p^{3}$,
if the only difference is the signs of the charges, then they are LU
equivalent. Thus, the partition of black holes is independent of the signs of
the charges and is only related to the ratio of the absolute charges.

  Grover's algorithm with qudits</h1>

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-23T18:05:44Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Qubits, which are quantum counterparts of classical bits, are used as basic
information units for quantum information processing, whereas underlying
physical information carriers, e.g. (artificial) atoms or ions, admit encoding
of more complex multilevel states -- qudits. Recently, significant attention is
paid to the idea of using qudit encoding as a way for further scaling quantum
processors. In this work, we present an efficient decomposition of the
generalized Toffoli gate on the five-level quantum systems, so-called ququints,
that uses ququints' space as the space of two qubits with a joint ancillary
state. The basic two-qubit operation that we use is a version of
controlled-phase gate. The proposed $N$-qubit Toffoli gate decomposition has
$O(N)$ asymptotic depth using no ancillary qubits. We then apply our results
for Grover's algorithm, where we indicate on the sizable advantage of the using
qudit-based approach with the proposed decomposition. We expect that our
results are applicable for quantum processors based on various physical
platforms.

  Excitations</h1>

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-23T16:48:20Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The Trotterized Unitary Coupled Cluster Single and Double (UCCSD) ansatz has
recently attracted interest due to its use in Variation Quantum Eigensolver
(VQE) molecular simulations on quantum computers. However, when the size of
molecules increases, UCCSD becomes less interesting as it cannot achieve
sufficient accuracy. Including higher-order excitations is therefore mandatory
to recover the UCC's missing correlation effects. In this Letter, we extend the
Trotterized UCC approach via the addition of (true) Triple T excitations
introducing UCCSDT. We also include both spin and orbital symmetries. Indeed,
in practice, these later help to reduce unnecessarily circuit excitations and
thus accelerate the optimization process enabling to tackle larger molecules.
Our initial numerical tests (12-14 qubits) show that UCCSDT improves the
overall accuracy by at least two-orders of magnitudes with respect to standard
UCCSD. Overall, the UCCSDT ansatz is shown to reach chemical accuracy and to be
competitive with the CCSD(T) gold-standard classical method of quantum
chemistry.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-23T16:05:24Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We present a technique for rapid site-selective control of the quantum state
of particles in a large array using a combination of a fast deflector (e.g. an
acousto-optic deflector) and a relatively slow spatial light modulator. The use
of spatial light modulators for site-selective quantum state manipulation has
been limited due to slow transition times preventing rapid, consecutive quantum
gates. By partitioning the spatial light modulator into multiple segments, and
using a fast deflector to transition between them, it is possible to
substantially reduce the average time increment between scanner transitions by
increasing the number of gates that can be performed for a single spatial light
modulator full frame setting. We analyze the performance of this device in two
different configurations: in configuration 1, each segment of the spatial light
modulator addresses the full qubit array; in configuration 2, each segment of
the spatial light modulator addresses a sub-array and an additional fast
deflector positions that sub-array with respect to the full qubit array. With
these hybrid scanners we calculate qubit addressing rates that are tens to
hundreds of times faster than using an SLM alone.

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Variational quantum algorithms are a promising tool for solving partial
differential equations. The standard approach for its numerical solution are
finite difference schemes, which can be reduced to the linear algebra problem.
We consider three approaches to solve the heat equation on a quantum computer.
Using the direct variational method we minimize the expectation value of a
Hamiltonian with its ground state being the solution of the problem under
study. Typically, an exponential number of Pauli products in the Hamiltonian
decomposition does not allow for the quantum speed up to be achieved. The
Hadamard test based approach solves this problem, however, the performed
simulations do not evidently prove that the Ansatz circuit has a polynomial
depth with respect to the number of qubits. The ansatz tree approach exploits
an explicit form of the matrix what makes it possible to achieve an advantage
over classical algorithms. In our numerical simulations with up to $n=8$
qubits, this method reveals the exponential speed up.

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Shor's algorithm has seriously challenged information security based on
public key cryptosystems. However, to break the widely used RSA-2048 scheme,
one needs millions of physical qubits, which is far beyond current technical
capabilities. Here, we report a universal quantum algorithm for integer
factorization by combining the classical lattice reduction with a quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The number of qubits required is
O(logN/loglog N), which is sublinear in the bit length of the integer $N$,
making it the most qubit-saving factorization algorithm to date. We demonstrate
the algorithm experimentally by factoring integers up to 48 bits with 10
superconducting qubits, the largest integer factored on a quantum device. We
estimate that a quantum circuit with 372 physical qubits and a depth of
thousands is necessary to challenge RSA-2048 using our algorithm. Our study
shows great promise in expediting the application of current noisy quantum
computers, and paves the way to factor large integers of realistic
cryptographic significance.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-23T14:10:13Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Quantum speed limits provide ultimate bounds on the time required to
transform one quantum state into another. Here, we extend the notion of quantum
speed limits to collections of quantum states, investigating the time for
converting a basis of states into an unbiased one. We provide tight bounds for
systems of dimension smaller than 5, and general bounds for multi-qubit systems
and Hilbert space dimension $d$. For two-qubit systems, we show that the
fastest transformation implements two Hadamards and a swap of the qubits
simultaneously. We further prove that for qutrit systems the evolution time
depends on the particular type of the unbiased basis. We also investigate speed
limits for coherence generation, providing the minimal time to establish a
certain amount of coherence with a unitary evolution.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>NMR investigations of Dynamical Tunneling in Spin Systems</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By V. R. Krithika, M. S. Santhanam, T. S. Mahesh</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-23T14:07:07Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  In chaotic Hamiltonian systems, dynamical tunneling refers to quantum
tunneling between states whose classical limit correspond to symmetry-related
regular regions separated by a chaotic zone. In the usual quantum tunneling, a
low-energy quantum particle penetrates across a physical barrier of higher
potential energy, by traversing a classically forbidden region, and finally
escapes into another region. In a similar scenario, a classical particle inside
a closed regular region is dynamically bound from escaping to other regions of
the phase space, whereas in the quantum regime tunneling permits escape through
dynamical barrier. Here, an experimental realization of dynamical tunneling in
spin systems is reported using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) architecture.
In particular, dynamical tunneling in quantum kicked tops of spin-1 and
spin-3/2 systems using two- and three-qubit NMR registers is investigated. By
extracting time-dependent expectation values of the angular momentum operator
components, size-dependent tunneling behaviour for various initial states is
systematically investigated. Further, by monitoring the adverse effects of
dephasing noise on the tunneling oscillations, we assert the importance of
quantum coherence in enabling dynamical tunneling.

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Single-electron sources are an essential component of modern quantum
nanoelectronic devices. Owing to their high accuracy and stability, they have
been successfully employed for metrology applications, studying fundamental
matter interactions and more recently for electron quantum optics. They are
traditionally driven by state-of-the-art arbitrary waveform generators that are
capable of producing single-electron pulses in the sub-100 ps timescale. In
this work, we use an alternative approach for generating ultrashort electron
wavepackets. By combining several harmonics provided by a frequency comb, we
synthesise Lorentzian voltage pulses and then use them to generate electron
wavepackets. Through this technique, we report on the generation and detection
of an electron wavepacket with temporal duration of 27 ps generated on top of
the Fermi sea of a 2-dimensional electron gas - the shortest reported to date.
Electron pulses this short enable studies on elusive, ultrafast fundamental
quantum dynamics in nanoelectronic systems and pave the way to implement flying
electron qubits by means of Levitons.

  of initial state coherence</h1>

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-23T11:57:47Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of an isolated bi-partite quantum
system, sunburst model, under interaction quench. The pre-quench limit of this
model is two non-interacting integrable systems, one a transverse Ising chain
while the other is finite number of isolated qubits. As a function of
interaction strength, the spectral fluctuation properties goes from Poisson to
Wigner-Dyson statistics. We chose entanglement entropy as a probe to study
approach to thermalization or lack of it in post-quench dynamics. In near
integrable limit, as expected, the linear entropy displays oscillatory
behaviour while in chaotic limit, it saturates. Along with the chaotic nature
of the time evolution generator, we show the importance of the role played by
coherence of initial state in deciding the nature of thermalization. We further
show that these findings are general by replacing Ising ring by disordered XXZ
model with disorder strength putting it in many-body localized phase.

  in a bosonic mode assisted by an ancillary qubit</h1>

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T23:32:21Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Bosonic quantum error correcting codes are primarily designed to protect
against single-photon loss. To correct for this type of error, one can encode
the logical qubit in code spaces with a definite photon parity, such as cat
codes or binomial codes. Error correction requires a recovery operation that
maps the error states -- which have opposite parity -- back onto the code
states. Here, we realize a collection of photon-number-selective, simultaneous
photon addition operations on a bosonic mode, a microwave cavity, assisted by a
superconducting qubit. These operations are implemented as two-photon
transitions that excite the cavity and the qubit at the same time. The
additional degree of freedom of the qubit makes it possible to implement a
coherent, unidirectional mapping between spaces of opposite photon parity. We
present the successful experimental implementation of the drives and the phase
control they enable on superpositions of Fock states. The presented technique,
when supplemented with qubit reset, is suitable for autonomous quantum error
correction in bosonic systems, and, more generally, opens the possibility to
realize a range of non-unitary transformations on a bosonic mode.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T23:21:39Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The design of quantum hardware that reduces and mitigates errors is essential
for practical quantum error correction (QEC) and useful quantum computations.
To this end, we introduce the circuit-QED dual-rail qubit in which our physical
qubit is encoded in the single-photon subspace of two superconducting cavities.
The dominant photon loss errors can be detected and converted into erasure
errors, which are much easier to correct. In contrast to linear optics, a
circuit-QED implementation of the dual-rail code offers completely new
capabilities. Using a single transmon ancilla, we describe a universal gate set
that includes state preparation, logical readout, and parametrizable single and
two-qubit gates. Moreover, first-order hardware errors due to the cavity and
transmon in all of these operations can be detected and converted to erasure
errors, leaving background Pauli errors that are orders of magnitude smaller.
Hence, the dual-rail cavity qubit delivers an optimal hierarchy of errors and
rates, and is expected to be well below the relevant QEC thresholds with
today's devices.

hardware-efficient mobile domain walls on magnetic racetracks. In our proposal,
the quantum information is encoded in the chirality of the spin structure of
nanoscale domain walls. We estimate that these qubits are long-lived and could
be operated at sweet spots reducing possible noise sources. Single-qubit gates
are implemented by controlling the movement of the walls in magnetic nanowires,
and two-qubit entangling gates take advantage of naturally emerging
interactions between different walls. These gates are sufficient for universal
quantum computing and are fully compatible with current state-of-the-art
experiments on racetrack memories. Possible schemes for qubit readout and
initialization are also discussed.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T18:58:20Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We introduce an open-source software library Graphix, which optimizes and
simulates measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). By combining the
measurement calculus with an efficient graph state simulator, Graphix allows
the classical preprocessing of Pauli measurements in the measurement patterns,
significantly reducing the number of operations required to perform the quantum
computation while maintaining determinism. For a measurement pattern translated
from a quantum circuit, this corresponds to the preprocessing of all Clifford
gates, and this improvement in the one-way model is important for efficient
operations in quantum hardware with limited qubit numbers. In addition to the
direct translation from gate networks, we provide a pattern generation method
based on flow-finding algorithms, which automatically generates byproduct
correction sequences to ensure determinism. We further implement optimization
strategies for measurement patterns beyond the standardization procedure and
provide tensor-network backend for classically simulating the MBQC.

quantum process tomography, showing an exponential reduction in the number of
different experimental configurations required by a single matrix element
extraction, while keeping the same number of shots. This paves the way for more
efficient experimental implementations, whenever a selective knowledge of the

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T18:07:29Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Encoding a qubit in a high quality superconducting microwave cavity offers
the opportunity to perform the first layer of error correction in a single
device, but presents a challenge: how can quantum oscillators be controlled
while introducing a minimal number of additional error channels? We focus on
the two-qubit portion of this control problem by using a 3-wave mixing coupling
element to engineer a programmable beamsplitter interaction between two bosonic
modes separated by more than an octave in frequency, without introducing major
additional sources of decoherence. Combining this with single-oscillator
control provided by a dispersively coupled transmon provides a framework for
quantum control of multiple encoded qubits. The beamsplitter interaction
$g_\text{bs}$ is fast relative to the timescale of oscillator decoherence,
enabling over $10^3$ beamsplitter operations per coherence time, and
approaching the typical rate of the dispersive coupling $\chi$ used for
individual oscillator control. Further, the programmable coupling is engineered
without adding unwanted interactions between the oscillators, as evidenced by
the high on-off ratio of the operations, which can exceed $10^5$. We then
introduce a new protocol to realize a hybrid controlled-SWAP operation in the
regime $g_{bs}\approx\chi$, in which a transmon provides the control bit for
the SWAP of two bosonic modes. Finally, we use this gate in a SWAP test to
project a pair of bosonic qubits into a Bell state with measurement-corrected
fidelity of $95.5\% \pm 0.2\%$.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T18:03:37Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Bosonic cat qubits stabilized by two-photon driven dissipation benefit from
exponential suppression of bit-flip errors and an extensive set of gates
preserving this protection. These properties make them promising building
blocks of a hardware-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum processor. In this
paper, we propose a performance optimization of the repetition cat code
architecture using fast but noisy CNOT gates for stabilizer measurements. This
optimization leads to high thresholds for the physical figure of merit, given
as the ratio between intrinsic single-photon loss rate of the bosonic mode and
the engineered two-photon loss rate, as well as a very interesting scaling
below threshold of the required overhead, to reach an expected level of logical
error rate. Relying on the specific error models for cat qubit operations, this
optimization exploits fast parity measurements, using accelerated low-fidelity
CNOT gates, combined with fast ancilla parity-check qubits. The significant
enhancement in the performance is explained by: 1- the highly asymmetric error
model of cat qubit CNOT gates with a major component on control (ancilla)
qubits, and 2- the robustness of the error correction performance in presence
of the leakage induced by fast operations. In order to demonstrate these
performances, we develop a method to sample the repetition code under
circuit-level noise that also takes into account cat qubit state leakage.

  probabilistic policy reuse</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Elisha Siddiqui Matekole, Esther Ye, Ramya Iyer, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T17:24:32Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Quantum computing (QC) promises significant advantages on certain hard
computational tasks over classical computers. However, current quantum
hardware, also known as noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ), are
still unable to carry out computations faithfully mainly because of the lack of
quantum error correction (QEC) capability. A significant amount of theoretical
studies have provided various types of QEC codes; one of the notable
topological codes is the surface code, and its features, such as the
requirement of only nearest-neighboring two-qubit control gates and a large
error threshold, make it a leading candidate for scalable quantum computation.
Recent developments of machine learning (ML)-based techniques especially the
reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been applied to the decoding problem
and have already made certain progress. Nevertheless, the device noise pattern
may change over time, making trained decoder models ineffective. In this paper,
we propose a continual reinforcement learning method to address these decoding
challenges. Specifically, we implement double deep Q-learning with
probabilistic policy reuse (DDQN-PPR) model to learn surface code decoding
strategies for quantum environments with varying noise patterns. Through
numerical simulations, we show that the proposed DDQN-PPR model can
significantly reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, increasing the
number of trained policies can further improve the agent's performance. Our
results open a way to build more capable RL agents which can leverage
previously gained knowledge to tackle QEC challenges.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T16:55:24Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The coherence times of state-of-the art quantum computers significantly
restricts the feasible computational depth. This, among other limitations such
as small qubit numbers, severely reduces the scope of algorithms that can be
run. While numerous techniques have been invented to make the most out of
fewer-qubit devices, analogous schemes for depth-limited computations are less
explored. This work investigates to what extent we can mimic the performance of
a deeper quantum computation by using a shallower device many times. We propose
a method for this inspired by the Feynman quantum circuit simulation approach,
where the circuit is cut and measured early on, and other circuits are run
based on the outcomes. The method applied naively is inefficient if the
so-called 'computational basis (CB) rank' is too large at the cut. We propose
to mitigate this using a shallow variational circuit, which we call the
reducer, and whose purpose is to maintain the CB rank within pre-defined
tolerable limits. As we discuss, this approach works for certain cases of
interest. We also provide a tailored optimisation method to find this reducer.
The method as presented likely will not immediately lead to new uses of large
currently available quantum computers due to practical bottlenecks we discuss,
but we believe it may stimulate new research towards exploiting the potential
of shallow quantum computers.

combination of spin and optical properties that make them prototypical
solid-state qubits. Despite the coherence of these spin qubits being critically
limited by spin-phonon relaxation, a full understanding of this process is not
yet available. Here we apply ab initio spin dynamics simulations to this
problem and quantitatively reproduce the experimental temperature dependence of
spin relaxation time and spin coherence time. We demonstrate that low-frequency
two-phonon modulations of the zero-field splitting are responsible for spin
relaxation and decoherence, and point to the nature of vibrations in
2-dimensional materials as the culprit for their shorter coherence time.

  Learning</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Yexiong Zeng, Zheng-Yang Zhou, Enrico Rinaldi, Clemens Gneiting, Franco Nori</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T12:42:52Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Autonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) protects logical qubits by
engineered dissipation and thus circumvents the necessity of frequent,
error-prone measurement-feedback loops. Bosonic code spaces, where
single-photon loss represents the dominant source of error, are promising
candidates for AQEC due to their flexibility and controllability. While
existing proposals have demonstrated the in-principle feasibility of AQEC with
bosonic code spaces, these schemes are typically based on the exact
implementation of the Knill-Laflamme conditions and thus require the
realization of Hamiltonian distances $d\geq 2$. Implementing such Hamiltonian
distances requires multiple nonlinear interactions and control fields,
rendering these schemes experimentally challenging. Here, we propose a bosonic
code for approximate AQEC by relaxing the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Using
reinforcement learning (RL), we identify the optimal bosonic set of codewords
(denoted here by RL code), which, surprisingly, is comprised of the Fock states
$\vert 2\rangle$ and $\vert 4\rangle$. As we show, the RL code, despite its
approximate nature, successfully suppresses single-photon loss, reducing it to
an effective dephasing process that well surpasses the break-even threshold. It
may thus provide a valuable building block toward full error protection. The
error-correcting Hamiltonian, which includes ancilla systems that emulate the
engineered dissipation, is entirely based on the Hamiltonian distance $d=1$,
significantly reducing model complexity. Single-qubit gates are implemented in
the RL code with a maximum distance $d_g=2$.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T11:58:12Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder is the standard decoding
strategy for quantum surface codes. However, it suffers a harsh decrease in
performance when subjected to biased or non-identical quantum noise. In this
work, we modify the conventional MWPM decoder so that it considers the biases
and non-uniformities of the constituent qubits of a given surface code. Our
modified approach, which we refer to as the recursive MWPM decoder, obtains an
$18\%$ improvement in the probability threshold $p_{th}$ under depolarizing
noise. We also obtain significant performance improvements when considering
biased noise and independent non-identically distributed (i.ni.d) error models
derived from measurements performed on state-of-the-art quantum processors. In
fact, when subjected to i.ni.d noise, the recursive MWPM decoder yields a
performance improvement of $105.5\%$ over the conventional MWPM strategy and,
in some cases, it even surpasses the performance obtained over the well-known
depolarizing channel.

A subclass of QML methods is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs)
which have been studied as a quantum counterpart of classical GANs widely used
in image manipulation and generation tasks. The existing work on QGANs is still
limited to small-scale proof-of-concept examples based on images with
significant down-scaling. Here we integrate classical and quantum techniques to
propose a new hybrid quantum-classical GAN framework. We demonstrate its
superior learning capabilities by generating $28 \times 28$ pixels grey-scale
images without dimensionality reduction or classical pre/post-processing on
multiple classes of the standard MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, which
achieves comparable results to classical frameworks with 3 orders of magnitude
less trainable generator parameters. To gain further insight into the working
of our hybrid approach, we systematically explore the impact of its parameter
space by varying the number of qubits, the size of image patches, the number of
layers in the generator, the shape of the patches and the choice of prior
distribution. Our results show that increasing the quantum generator size
generally improves the learning capability of the network. The developed
framework provides a foundation for future design of QGANs with optimal
parameter set tailored for complex image generation tasks.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Michele Aldeghi, Rolf Allenspach, Gian Salis</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-22T11:17:32Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  On-chip micromagnets enable electrically controlled quantum gates on electron
spin qubits. Extending the concept to a large number of qubits is challenging
in terms of providing large enough driving gradients and individual
addressability. Here we present a design aimed at driving spin qubits arranged
in a linear chain and strongly confined in directions lateral to the chain.
Nanomagnets are placed laterally to one side of the qubit chain, one nanomagnet
per two qubits. The individual magnets are "U"-shaped, such that the magnetic
shape anisotropy orients the magnetization alternately towards and against the
qubit chain even if an external magnetic field is applied along the qubit
chain. The longitudinal and transversal stray field components serve as
addressability and driving fields. Using micromagnetic simulations we calculate
driving and dephasing rates and the corresponding qubit quality factor. The
concept is validated with spin-polarized scanning electron microscopy of Fe
nanomagnets fabricated on silicon substrates, finding excellent agreement with
micromagnetic simulations. Several features required for a scalable spin qubit
design are met in our approach: strong driving and weak dephasing gradients,
reduced crosstalk and operation at low external magnetic field.

  eigensolver: orbital optimization goes adaptive</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Aaron Fitzpatrick, Anton Nykänen, N. Walter Talarico, Alessandro Lunghi, Sabrina Maniscalco, Guillermo García-Pérez, Stefan Knecht</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T23:15:17Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We present a self consistent field approach (SCF) within the Adaptive
Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored Ansatz Variational Quantum Eigensolver
(ADAPT-VQE) framework for efficient quantum simulations of chemical systems on
near-term quantum computers. To this end, our ADAPT-VQE-SCF approach combines
the idea of generating an ansatz with a small number of parameters, resulting
in shallow-depth quantum circuits with a direct minimization of an energy
expression which is correct to second order with respect to changes in the
molecular orbital basis. Our numerical analysis, including calculations for the
transition metal complex ferrocene (Fe$\rm (C_5H_5)_2$), indicates that
convergence in the self-consistent orbital optimization loop can be reached
without a considerable increase in the number of two-qubit gates in the quantum
circuit by comparison to a VQE optimization in the initial molecular orbital
basis. Moreover, the orbital optimization can be carried out simultaneously
within each iteration of the ADAPT-VQE cycle. ADAPT-VQE-SCF thus allows us to
implement a routine analogous to CASSCF, a cornerstone of state-of-the-art
computational chemistry, in a hardware-efficient manner on near-term quantum
computers. Hence, ADAPT-VQE-SCF paves the way towards a paradigm shift for
quantitative quantum-chemistry simulations on quantum computers by requiring
fewer qubits and opening up for the use of large and flexible atomic orbital
basis sets in contrast to earlier methods that are predominantly based on the
idea of full active spaces with minimal basis sets.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T22:59:43Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We demonstrate a superconducting artificial atom with strong unidirectional
coupling to a microwave photonic waveguide. Our artificial atom is realized by
coupling a transmon qubit to the waveguide at two spatially separated points
with time-modulated interactions. Direction-sensitive interference arising from
the parametric couplings in our scheme results in a non-reciprocal response,
where we measure a forward/backward ratio of spontaneous emission exceeding
100. We verify the quantum nonlinear behavior of this artificial chiral atom by
measuring the resonance fluorescence spectrum under a strong resonant drive and
observing well-resolved Mollow triplets. Further, we demonstrate chirality for
the second transition energy of the artificial atom and control it with a pulse
sequence to realize a qubit-state-dependent non-reciprocal phase on itinerant
photons. Our demonstration puts forth a superconducting hardware platform for
the scalable realization of several key functionalities pursued within the
paradigm of chiral quantum optics, including quantum networks with all-to-all
connectivity, driven-dissipative stabilization of many-body entanglement, and
the generation of complex non-classical states of light.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Matthew P. Stafford, Nicolas C. Menicucci</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T22:56:05Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Continuous-variable quantum computing architectures based upon the
Gottesmann-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding have emerged as a promising candidate
because one can achieve fault-tolerance with a probabilistic supply of GKP
states and Gaussian operations. Furthermore, by generalising to
rectangular-lattice GKP states, a bias can be introduced and exploited through
concatenation with qubit codes that show improved performance under biasing.
However, these codes (such as the XZZX surface code) still require weight-four
stabiliser measurements and have complex decoding requirements to overcome. In
this work, we study the code-capacity behaviour of a rectangular-lattice GKP
encoding concatenated with a repetition code under an isotropic Gaussian
displacement channel. We find a numerical threshold of $\sigma = 0.599$ for the
noise's standard deviation, which outperforms the biased GKP planar surface
code with a trade-off of increased biasing at the GKP level. This is all
achieved with only weight-two stabiliser operators and simple decoding at the
qubit level. Furthermore, with moderate levels of bias (aspect ratio $\leq
2.4$) and nine or fewer data modes, significant reductions in logical error
rates can still be achieved for $\sigma \leq 0.3$, opening the possibility of
using GKP-biased repetition codes as a simple low-level qubit encoding for
further concatenation.

  NISQ-era</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Amit Saha, Anupam Chattopadhyay, Amlan Chakrabarti</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T19:00:53Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Numerous scientific developments in this NISQ-era (Noisy Intermediate Scale
Quantum) have raised the importance for quantum algorithms relative to their
conventional counterparts due to its asymptotic advantage. For resource
estimates in several quantum algorithms, arithmetic operations are crucial.
With resources reported as a number of Toffoli gates or T gates with/without
ancilla, several efficient implementations of arithmetic operations, such as
addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, square root, etc., have been
accomplished in binary quantum systems. More recently, it has been shown that
intermediate qutrits may be employed in the ancilla-free frontier zone,
enabling us to function effectively there. In order to achieve efficient
implementation of all the above-mentioned quantum arithmetic operations with
regard to gate count and circuit-depth without T gate and ancilla, we have
included an intermediate qutrit method in this paper. Future research aiming at
reducing costs while taking into account arithmetic operations for computing
tasks might be guided by our resource estimations using intermediate qutrits.
Therefore, the enhancements are examined in relation to the fundamental
arithmetic circuits. The intermediate qutrit approach necessitates access to
higher energy levels, making the design susceptible to errors. We nevertheless
demonstrate that the percentage decrease in the probability of error is
significant due to the fact that we achieve circuit efficiency by reducing
circuit-depth in comparison to qubit-only works.

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Matter qubit to photonic qubit conversion is the cornerstone of numerous
quantum technologies such as distributed quantum computing, as well as several
quantum internet and networking protocols. We find the upper limit for the
photonic pulse emission efficiency of arbitrary matter qubit states for
imperfect emitters and show a path forward to optimize the fidelity. We
formulate a theory for stimulated Raman emission which is applicable to a wide
range of physical systems including quantum dots, solid state defects, and
trapped ions, as well as various parameter regimes, including arbitrary pulse
durations. Furthermore, the mathematical idea to use input-output theory for
pulses to absorb the dominant emission process into the coherent dynamics,
followed by a quantum trajectory approach has great potential to study other
physical systems.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T17:12:20Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Bosonic quantum error correction has proven to be a successful approach for
extending the coherence of quantum memories, but to execute deep quantum
circuits, high-fidelity gates between encoded qubits are needed. To that end,
we present a family of error-detectable two-qubit gates for a variety of
bosonic encodings. From a new geometric framework based on a "Bloch sphere" of
bosonic operators, we construct $ZZ_L(\theta)$ and $\text{eSWAP}(\theta)$ gates
for the binomial, 4-legged cat, dual-rail and several other bosonic codes. The
gate Hamiltonian is simple to engineer, requiring only a programmable
beamsplitter between two bosonic qubits and an ancilla dispersively coupled to
one qubit. This Hamiltonian can be realized in circuit QED hardware with
ancilla transmons and microwave cavities. The proposed theoretical framework
was developed for circuit QED but is generalizable to any platform that can
effectively generate this Hamiltonian. Crucially, one can also detect
first-order errors in the ancilla and the bosonic qubits during the gates. We
show that this allows one to reach error-detected gate fidelities at the
$10^{-4}$ level with today's hardware, limited only by second-order hardware
errors.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T16:36:10Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Xie and Eberly introduced a genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) measure
`concurrence fill'(\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett., \textbf{127}, 040403 (2021)}) for
three-party systems. It is defined as the area of a triangle whose side lengths
represent squared concurrence in each bi-partition. We present a direct
extension of the GME to four-party systems. However, contrary to the conjecture
presented by the authors, it can not be simply extended to be the volume of a
tetrahedron, with each face area as the squared concurrence. The more complex
entanglement structure for four-qubit systems, where absolute maximally
entangled states do not exist, comprises two different types of bi-partitions
and reveals a richer geometrical interpretation of the GME measure. Our GME
measure can be geometrically interpreted as a combination of areas of two types
of planar structures (resulting from two types of bi-partition). One of them is
a cyclic quadrilateral, and the other one is a triangle (the sides representing
squared concurrence). In the process, we identify several constraints for the
bipartite concurrences and show the non-existence of several entanglement
configurations for four qubit systems, supporting the validity of our GME
measure for four-party states.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T16:31:27Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The divergent timescales of slow relaxation processes are obstacles to the
study of stationary state properties and the functionalization of some systems
like steady state heat engines, both in classical and quantum systems. Thus the
shortening of the relaxation time scale would be desirable in many cases. Here
we claim that using quantum reset, a common and important operation in quantum
computation, the relaxation dynamics of general Markovian open quantum systems
with arbitrary initial states is able to be accelerated significantly through a
simple protocol. This faster relaxation induced by the reset protocol is
reminiscent of the quantum Mpemba effect. The reset protocol we proposed is
applied to a two-state quantum systems to illustrate our theory, which may
characterize a single qubit or a spin. Furthermore, our new strategy to
accelerate relaxations may also be applied to closed quantum systems or even
some non-Markovian open quantum systems.

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Quantum optimal control includes the family of pulse-shaping algorithms that
aim to unlock the full potential of a variety of quantum technologies. Our
Quantum Optimal Control Suite (QuOCS) unites experimental focus and model-based
approaches in a unified framework. The easy usage and installation of QuOCS and
the availability of various combinable optimization strategies is designed to
improve the performance of many quantum technology platforms, such as color
defects in diamond, superconducting qubits, atom- or ion-based quantum
computers. It can also be applied to the study of more general phenomena in
physics. In this paper, we describe the software and the main toolbox of
gradient-free and gradient-based algorithms. We then show how the user can
connect it to their experiment. In addition, we provide illustrative examples
where our optimization suite solves typical quantum optimal control problems,
in both open- and closed-loop settings. Integration into existing experimental
control software is already provided for the experiment control software Qudi
[J. M. Binder et al., SoftwareX, 6, 85-90, (2017)], and further extensions are
investigated and highly encouraged. QuOCS is available from GitHub, under
Apache License 2.0, and can be found on the PyPI repository.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T15:38:56Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Inspired by a recent Letter [S. R. Beane et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122,
102001(2019)], the entanglement generated in the elastic $S$-wave scattering of
$p+{}^{3}\text{He}$ and $n+{}^3\text{H}$ is studied, where the proton, neutron,
${}^{3}$He, and ${}^3$H are all regarded as qubits. To deal with the Coulomb
interaction between the proton and ${}^{3}$He, we derive the entanglement
power, a physical quantity that measures the average entanglement generated by
a scattering process, for charged qubits within the screening method. The
entanglement power in the aforementioned two few-nucleon scatterings is found
to be generally much smaller than that in the $S$-wave $n+p$ scattering at low
energies, with the corresponding cluster effective field theories possessing an
enhanced approximate $\text{SU}(2)_1\otimes\text{SU}(2)_{2}$ symmetry at
leading order. Our study suggests that the entanglement generation capacities
of effective interactions between nucleons and light nuclei could be more
suppressed than realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions at low energies.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T14:23:48Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Finding energy differences between eigenstates of a quantum system, which
contains key information about its properties, is a central task in many-body
physics. Quantum computers promise to perform this task more efficiently than
classical hardware; however, extraction of this information remains
challenging. Non-trivial protocols for this task require either a substantial
increase in circuit complexity (phase estimation) or a large number of circuit
repetitions (variational quantum eigensolvers). Here we present shadow
spectroscopy, a novel simulator-agnostic quantum algorithm which extracts
energy gaps using an extremely low number of circuit repetitions (shots) and no
extra resources (ancilla qubits) beyond performing time evolution and
measurements. The approach builds on the fundamental feature that every
observable property of a quantum system must evolve according to the same
harmonic components, whose frequencies can be extracted from classical shadows
of time-evolved quantum states. Classical post processing of the large set of
resulting time-periodic signals directly reveals Hamiltonian energy differences
with Heisenberg-limited precision. While the classical computational complexity
is linear, the number of circuit repetitions (quantum resources) required is
only logarithmic in the number of analysed observables. Moreover, applying
shadow spectroscopy numerically to probe model systems and CH$_2$ excited
states verifies that the approach is intuitively easy to use in practice, very
robust against gate noise, amiable to a new type of algorithmic-error
mitigation technique, and uses orders of magnitude fewer number of shots than
typical near-term quantum algorithms -- as low as 10 shots per timestep is
sufficient.

  applications</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Anuma Garg, Satyabrata Adhikari</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T09:52:57Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Nonlocality is a feature of quantum mechanics that cannot be explained by
local realistic theory. It can be detected by the violation of Bell inequality.
We have investigated the problem of detection of nonlocality with the help of
an XOR game in which the players may share a two-qubit entangled state
$\rho_{AB}^{ent}$. The shared state may generate a nonlocal correlation between
the players which is related to the maximum probability $P^{max}$ of success of
the game. For the detection of nonlocality of $\rho_{AB}^{ent}$, we have
defined a quantity known as strength of nonlocality denoted by
$S_{NL}(\rho_{AB}^{ent})$. We mainly deal with the situation when $P^{max}$
fails to detect the nonlocality of $\rho_{AB}^{ent}$. To study this problem, we
have established a relation between $P^{max}$ and the expectation value of the
CHSH witness operator $W_{CHSH}$ and hence between $S_{NL}(\rho_{AB}^{ent})$
and $W_{CHSH}$. We found that this relationship fails to detect nonlocality
when $W_{CHSH}$ does not detect the state $\rho_{AB}^{ent}$. In this case, we
developed a process by which we may estimate $S_{NL}(\rho_{AB}^{ent})$. We
further obtain an upper bound of $S_{NL}(\rho_{AB}^{ent})$ in terms of optimal
witness operator $W^{opt}$ when it detect the state $\rho_{AB}^{ent}$. We
establish a linkage between the two-qubit nonlocality determined by the
strength of nonlocality and the three-qubit nonlocality determined by the
Svetlichny operator. Lastly, as an application, we have used the introduced
measure of non-locality $S_{NL}(\rho_{23})$ to determine the upper bound of the
power of the controller in the controlled quantum teleportation, where
$\rho_{23}$ denote the reduced density operator of the pure three-qubit state
$\rho_{123}$.

  qubits</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Qiu-Cheng Song, Travis J. Baker, Howard M. Wiseman</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-21T07:35:19Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  As originally introduced, the EPR phenomenon was the ability of one party
(Alice) to steer, by her choice between two measurement settings, the quantum
system of another party (Bob) into two distinct ensembles of pure states. As
later formalized as a quantum information task, EPR-steering can be shown even
when the distinct ensembles comprise mixed states, provided they are pure
enough and different enough. Consider the scenario where Alice and Bob each
have a qubit and Alice performs dichotomic projective measurements. In this
case, the states in the ensembles to which she can steer form the surface of an
ellipsoid ${\cal E}$ in Bob's Bloch ball. Further, let the steering ellipsoid
${\cal E}$ have nonzero volume. It has previously been shown that if Alice's
first measurement setting yields an ensemble comprising two pure states, then
this, plus any one other measurement setting, will demonstrate EPR-steering.
Here we consider what one can say if the ensemble from Alice's first setting
contains only one pure state $\mathsf{p}\in{\cal E}$, occurring with
probability $p_\mathsf{p}$. Using projective geometry, we derive the necessary
and sufficient condition analytically for Alice to be able to demonstrate
EPR-steering of Bob's state using this and some second setting, when the two
ensembles from these lie in a given plane. Based on this, we show that, for a
given ${\cal E}$, if $p_\mathsf{p}$ is high enough [$p_{\sf p} > p_{\rm
max}^{{\cal E}} \in [0,1)$] then any distinct second setting by Alice is
sufficient to demonstrate EPR-steering. Similarly we derive a $p_{\rm
min}^{{\cal E}}$ such that $p_\mathsf{p}>p_{\rm min}^{{\cal E}}$ is necessary
for Alice to demonstrate EPR-steering using only the first setting and some
other setting. Moreover, the expressions we derive are tight; for spherical
steering ellipsoids, the bounds coincide: $p_{\rm max}^{{\cal E}} = p_{\rm
min}^{{\cal E}}$.

  squeezing drive</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Jia-Hao Lü, Wen Ning, Xin Zhu, Fan Wu, Li-Tuo Shen, Zhen-Biao Yang, Shi-Biao Zheng</i></p>

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Quantum sensing improves the accuracy of measurements of relevant parameters
by exploiting the unique properties of quantum systems. The divergent
susceptibility of physical systems near a critical point for quantum phase
transition enables criticality-enhanced quantum sensing. The quantum Rabi model
(QRM), composed of a single qubit coupled to a single bosonic field, represents
a good candidate for realizing such critical enhancement for its simplicity,
but it is experimentally challenging to achieve the ultrastrong qubit-field
coupling required to realize the critical phenomena. In this work, we explore
an alternative to construct the analog of the QRM for the sensing, exploiting
the criticality appearing in the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model whose bosonic field
is parametrically driven, not necessitating the ultrastrong coupling condition
thus to some extent relaxing the requirement for the practical implementation.

    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Fault-tolerant syndrome extraction is a key ingredient in implementing
fault-tolerant quantum computations. While conventional methods use a number of
extra qubits linear in the weight of the syndrome, several improvements have
been introduced using flag gadgets. In this work, we develop a framework to
design flag gadgets using classical codes. Using this framework we show how to
perform fault-tolerant syndrome extraction for any stabilizer code with
arbitrary distance using exponentially fewer qubits than conventional methods
when qubit measurement and reset are relatively slow compared to a round of
error correction. We further take advantage of the exponential saving provided
by our construction to fault-tolerantly measure multiple stabilizers using a
single gadget. Using the developed framework we perform computer-assisted
search to find several small examples where our constructions reduce the number
of qubits required. These small examples may be relevant to near-term
experiments on small-scale quantum computers.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T22:58:37Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Liquid He-4 is free from magnetic defects, making it an ideal substrate for
electrons with long-lived spin states. Such states can serve as qubit states.
Here we consider the spin states of electrons electrostatically localized in
quantum dots on a helium surface. Efficient gate operations in this system
require spin-orbit coupling. It can be created by a nonuniform magnetic field
from a current-carrying wire, can be turned on and off, and allows one to
obtain large electro-dipole moment and comparatively fast coupling of spins in
neighboring dots. Of central importance is to understand the spin decay due to
the spin-orbit coupling. We establish the leading mechanism of such decay and
show that the decay is sufficiently slow to enable high-fidelity single- and
two-qubit gate operations

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T21:20:37Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  In this thesis, we report the theoretical and experimental investigations
towards the creation, characterization, and manipulation of quantum
entanglement in a photonic system. We examine two different aspects of quantum
entanglement: In the first part, we discuss the experimental method for the
preparation and characterization of SPDC-based polarization-entangled photon
source. We provide a review study comparing different Entanglement Measures for
non-maximally entangled two-qubit pure states and extend this analysis to
higher-dimensional systems. In the second part, we study the entanglement
dynamics of a two-qubit system in the presence of an Amplitude Damping Channel
and present a scheme based on local unitary operations to protect entanglement
from undergoing Entanglement Sudden Death. We extend the decoherence study to
qubit-qutrit and qutrit-qutrit entangled systems and propose an entanglement
protection scheme for the higher dimensional system.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T19:27:45Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Nowadays, quantum computing has reached the engineering phase, with
fully-functional quantum processors integrating hundred of noisy qubits
available. Yet -- to fully unveil the potential of quantum computing out of the
labs and into business reality -- the challenge ahead is to substantially scale
the qubit number, reaching orders of magnitude exceeding the thousands (if not
millions) of noise-free qubits. To this aim, there exists a broad consensus
among both academic and industry communities about considering the distributed
computing paradigm as the key solution for achieving such a scaling, by
envision multiple moderate-to-small-scale quantum processors communicating and
cooperating to execute computational tasks exceeding the computational
resources available within a single processing device. The aim of this survey
is to provide the reader with an overview about the main challenges and open
problems arising with distributed quantum computing, and with an easy access
and guide towards the relevant literature and the prominent results from a
computer/communications engineering perspective.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Soumik Ghosh, Abhinav Deshpande, Dominik Hangleiter, Alexey V. Gorshkov, Bill Fefferman</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T19:00:08Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Entanglement is one of the physical properties of quantum systems responsible
for the computational hardness of simulating quantum systems. But while the
runtime of specific algorithms, notably tensor network algorithms, explicitly
depends on the amount of entanglement in the system, it is unknown whether this
connection runs deeper and entanglement can also cause inherent,
algorithm-independent complexity. In this work, we quantitatively connect the
entanglement present in certain quantum systems to the computational complexity
of simulating those systems. Moreover, we completely characterize the
entanglement and complexity as a function of a system parameter. Specifically,
we consider the task of simulating single-qubit measurements of $k$--regular
graph states on $n$ qubits. We show that, as the regularity parameter is
increased from $1$ to $n-1$, there is a sharp transition from an easy regime
with low entanglement to a hard regime with high entanglement at $k=3$, and a
transition back to easy and low entanglement at $k=n-3$. As a key technical
result, we prove a duality for the simulation complexity of regular graph
states between low and high regularity.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Junxiang Huang, Wenhao He, Yukun Zhang, Yusen Wu, Bujiao Wu, Xiao Yuan</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T16:59:54Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Near-term quantum devices generally have shallow circuit depth and hence
limited expressivity due to noise and decoherence. Here we introduce tensor
network assisted parameterized quantum circuits, concatenating a classical
tensor network operator to a quantum circuit and hence effectively increasing
the circuit expressivity without physically realizing a deeper circuit. We
propose a framework of tensor network assisted variational quantum algorithms,
allowing the solution of quantum many-body problems with shallower quantum
circuits. We consider two examples of unitary matrix product operators and
unitary tree tensor networks and demonstrate that they can both be efficiently
implemented. We numerically show that the expressivity is greatly enhanced with
the assistance of tensor networks. We test our method for 2D Ising models and
1D time crystal Hamiltonian models with up to 16 qubits. The numerical results
show that our method consistently outperforms the conventional approach with
shallow quantum circuits.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T16:23:04Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Quantum circuits must run on quantum computers with tight limits on qubit and
gate counts. To generate circuits respecting both limits, a promising
opportunity is exploiting uncomputation to trade qubits for gates. We present
Reqomp, a method to automatically synthesize correct and efficient
uncomputation of ancillae while respecting hardware constraints. For a given
circuit, Reqomp can offer a wide range of trade-offs between tightly
constraining qubit count or gate count. Our evaluation demonstrates that Reqomp
can significantly reduce the number of required ancilla qubits by up to 96%. On
80% of our benchmarks, the ancilla qubits required can be reduced by at least
25% while never incurring a gate count increase beyond 28%.

  to mitigate noise and reduce errors for the variational quantum eigensolver</h1>

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T13:03:48Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Quantum processing units boost entanglement at the level of hardware and
enable physical simulations of highly correlated electron states in molecules
and intermolecular chemical bonds. The variational quantum eigensolver provides
a hardware-efficient toolbox for ground state simulation; however, with
limitations in precision. Even in the absence of noise, the algorithm may
result into a biased energy estimation, particularly with some shallower ansatz
types. Noise additionally degrades entanglement and hinders the ground state
energy estimation (especially if the noise is not fully characterized). Here we
develop a method to exploit the quantum-classical interface provided by
informationally complete measurements to use classical software on top of the
hardware entanglement booster for ansatz- and noise-related error reduction. We
use the tensor network representation of a quantum channel that drives the
noisy state toward the ground one. The tensor network is a completely positive
map by construction, but we elaborate on making the trace preservation
condition local so as to activate the sweeping variational optimization. This
method brings into reach energies below the noiseless ansatz by creating
additional correlations among the qubits and denoising them. Analyzing the
example of the stretched water molecule with a tangible entanglement, we argue
that a hybrid strategy of using the quantum hardware together with the
classical software outperforms a purely classical strategy provided the
classical parts have the same bond dimension. The proposed optimization
algorithm extends the variety of noise mitigation methods and facilitates the
more accurate study of the energy landscape for deformed molecules. The
algorithm can be applied as the final postprocessing step in the quantum
hardware simulation of protein-ligand complexes in the context of drug design.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Aninda Sinha, Ahmadullah Zahed</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T12:47:51Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  For 2-2 scattering of photons, gravitons, fermions and pions, we consider
entanglement in isospin and helicity. While the photon, graviton and fermion
examples involve qubits, pions are qutrits. We calculate the relevant Bell
inequalities for these processes. {For photon scattering at low energies, QED
lies almost at the theory space boundary which separates the Bell violating
theories from the non-violating theories}. Allowing for graviton exchange and
demanding Bell violation in photon scattering, we find that the Weak Gravity
Conjecture is satisfied. For 2-2 graviton scattering, we find that CEMZ bounds
allow for at most small Bell violations. Restriction on the Weinberg angle is
found by demanding Bell violation in Bhabha scattering. We use recent S-matrix
bootstrap data for pions and photons to study the Bell parameter in the space
of allowed S-matrices. In the photon case, we study the Bell parameters as a
function of energy and find support for the EFT observations. For pions, we
find that there is a minimization of a suitable Bell parameter for S-matrices
which exhibit Regge behaviour.

electrodynamics (cQED) system beyond the dispersive coupling regime. Treating
the cavity as part of the driven system, we develop a theory applicable to such
strongly coupled and to multi-qubit systems. The fringes measured for a single
driven double quantum dot (DQD)-cavity setting and the enlarged splittings of
the hybrid Floquet states in the presence of a second DQD are well reproduced
with our model. This opens a path to study Floquet states of multi-qubit
systems with arbitrarily strong coupling and reveals a new perspective for
understanding strongly driven hybrid systems.

  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T10:53:24Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We investigate the robustness of two-qubit gates to deviations of
experimental controls, on a neutral atom platform utilizing Rydberg states. We
construct robust CZ gates - employing techniques from quantum optimal control -
that retain high Bell state fidelity $F > 0.999$ in the presence of significant
deviations of the coupling strength to the Rydberg state. Such deviations can
arise from laser intensity noise and atomic motion in an inhomogeneous coupling
field. We also discuss methods to mitigate errors due to deviations of the
laser detuning. The designed pulses operate on timescales that are short
compared to the fundamental decay timescale set by spontaneous emission and
blackbody radiation. We account for the finite lifetime of the Rydberg state in
both the optimisation and fidelity calculations - this makes the gates
conducive to noisy intermediate-scale quantum experiments, meaning that our
protocols can reduce infidelity on near-term quantum computing devices. We
calculate physical properties associated with infidelity for strontium-88 atoms
- including lifetimes, polarisabilities and blockade strengths - and use these
calculations to identify optimal Rydberg states for our protocols, which allows
for further minimisation of infidelity.

  despite a constant energy gap</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Hiroshi Hayasaka, Takashi Imoto, Yuichiro Matsuzaki, Shiro Kawabata</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-20T04:43:40Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Quantum annealing (QA) is one of the methods to solve combinatorial
optimization problems. We can estimate a computational time of QA by using the
so-called adiabatic condition derived from the adiabatic theorem. The adiabatic
condition consists of two parts: an energy gap and a transition matrix. It is
believed that the computational time mainly depends on the energy gap during QA
and is inversely proportional to a polynomial of the minimal energy gap. In
this paper, we challenge this common wisdom. We propose a general method to
construct counterintuitive models with a constant energy gap during QA where QA
with a constant annealing time fails despite a constant energy gap. In our
formalism, we choose a known model exhibiting an exponentially small energy gap
during QA, and we modify the model by adding a specific penalty term to the
Hamiltonian. In the modified model, the transition matrix in the adiabatic
condition becomes exponentially large with the number of qubits, while the
energy gap remains constant. As concrete examples we consider the adiabatic
Grover search and the ferromagnetic p-spin model. In these cases, by adding the
penalty term, the success probability of QA in the modified models become
exponentially small despite a constant energy gap. Our results paves a way for
better understanding of the QA performance.
