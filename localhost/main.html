    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Quantum chemistry is one of the most promising applications of quantum
computing with wide applications in chemistry, drug discovery, material
science, etc. Recent theoretical and experimental works have demonstrated the
potentiality of solving molecular electronic structures with existing quantum
hardware. However, scalable realisations of these algorithms on current quantum
devices remain challenging. The state-of-the-art experiments are either
restricted to a few qubits or have limited scalability or accuracy. Here,
integrating experimental and theoretical advances in more accurate operations
and dedicated optimisation of the algorithm, we show an implementation of
variational quantum eigensolver with a scalable and optimised multi-reference
unitary coupled cluster circuit for H2, LiH, F2 from 4 to 12 qubits. Combining
error mitigation schemes, we show high-accuracy results of the ground-state
energy with around two orders of suppression in errors, and we achieve chemical
accuracy for H2 at all bond distances and LiH at small bond distances. Our work
demonstrates a feasible path to a scalable solution of electronic structures,
validating key technological features and identifying future challenges for
this goal.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Inferring Quantum Network Topology using Local Measurements</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Daniel T. Chen, Brian Doolittle, Jeffrey M. Larson, Zain H. Saleem, Eric Chitambar</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T17:36:12Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The topology of a quantum network is crucial for understanding statistical
correlations across nodes in the network. However, this information might not
be known a priori or has to be verified. In this paper, we propose an efficient
protocol for inferring the topology of a quantum network. We leverage entropic
quantities -- namely, the von Neumann entropy and the measured mutual
information -- to uniquely characterize the topology. Since only local
measurements are needed, the protocol is practical and can be readily applied
to quantum hardware. We also show that the protocol can be entirely robust to
independent depolarizing noise when qubit measurements are available.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Accelerating Quantum Computations of Chemistry Through Regularized
  Compressed Double Factorization</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Oumarou Oumarou, Maximilian Scheurer, Robert M. Parrish, Edward G. Hohenstein, Christian Gogolin</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T16:42:07Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  We propose the regularized compressed double factorization (RC-DF) method to
classically compute compressed representations of molecular Hamiltonians that
enable efficient simulation with noisy intermediate scale (NISQ) and error
corrected quantum algorithms. We find that already for small systems with 12 to
20 qubits, the resulting NISQ measurement scheme reduces the number of
measurement bases by roughly a factor of three and the shot count to reach
chemical accuracy by a factor of three to six compared to truncated double
factorization (DF) and we see order of magnitude improvements over Pauli
grouping schemes. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach by performing
RC-DF on the Cpd I species of cytochrome P450 with 58 orbitals and find that
using the resulting compressed Hamiltonian cuts the run time of qubitization
and truncated DF based error corrected algorithms almost in half and even
outperforms the lambda parameters achievable with tensor hypercontraction (THC)
while at the same time reducing the CCSD(T) energy error heuristic by an order
of magnitude.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Complete characterization of quantum correlations by randomized
  measurements</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Nikolai Wyderka, Andreas Ketterer, Satoya Imai, Jan Lennart Bönsel, Daniel E. Jones, Brian T. Kirby, Xiao-Dong Yu, Otfried Gühne</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T15:22:28Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The fact that quantum mechanics predicts stronger correlations than classical
physics is an essential cornerstone of quantum information processing. Indeed,
these quantum correlations are a valuable resource for various tasks, such as
quantum key distribution or quantum teleportation, but characterizing these
correlations in an experimental setting is a formidable task. By definition,
quantum correlations are invariant under local transformations; this physically
motivated invariance implies, however, a dedicated mathematical structure and,
therefore, constitutes a roadblock for an efficient analysis of these
correlations in experiments. Here we provide a method to directly measure any
locally invariant property of quantum states using locally randomized
measurements, and we present a detailed toolbox to analyze these correlations
for two quantum bits. We implement these methods experimentally using pairs of
entangled photons, characterizing their usefulness for quantum teleportation
and their potential to display quantum nonlocality in its simplest form. Our
results can be applied to various quantum computing platforms, allowing simple
analysis of correlations between arbitrary distant qubits in the architecture.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>On Fault Tolerance of Circuits with Intermediate Qutrit-assisted Gate
  Decomposition</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Ritajit Majumdar, Amit Saha, Amlan Chakrabarti, Susmita Sur-Kolay</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T14:33:45Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The use of a few intermediate qutrits for efficient decomposition of 3-qubit
unitary gates has been proposed, to obtain an exponential reduction in the
depth of the decomposed circuit. An intermediate qutrit implies that a qubit is
operated as a qutrit in a particular execution cycle. This method, primarily
for the NISQ era, treats a qubit as a qutrit only for the duration when it
requires access to the state |2> during the computation. In this article, we
study the challenges of including fault-tolerance in such a decomposition. We
first show that any qubit which requires access to the state |2> at any point
in the circuit, must be encoded using a qutrit quantum error correcting code
(QECC), thus resulting in a circuit with both qubits and qutrits at the outset.
Since qutrits are noisier than qubits, the former is expected to require higher
levels of concatenation to achieve a particular accuracy than that for qubit
only decomposition. Next, we derive analytically (i) the number of levels of
concatenation required for qubit-qutrit and qubit only decompositions as a
function of the probability of error, and (ii) the criterion for which
qubit-qutrit decomposition leads to a lower gate count than qubit only
decomposition. We present numerical results for these two types of
decomposition, and obtain the situation where qubit-qutrit decomposition excels
for the example circuits of quantum adder, and Grover's algorithm.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Quantum error correction under numerically exact open-quantum-system
  dynamics</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Aravind Plathanam Babu, Tuure Orell, Vasilii Vadimov, Wallace Teixeira, Mikko Möttönen, Matti Silveri</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T10:45:44Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The known quantum error-correcting codes are typically built on approximative
open-quantum-system models such as Born--Markov master equations. However, it
is an open question how such codes perform in actual physical systems that, to
some extent, necessarily exhibit phenomena beyond the limits of these models.
To this end, we employ numerically exact open-quantum-system dynamics to
analyze the performance of a five-qubit error correction code where each qubit
is coupled to its own bath. We first focus on the performance of a single error
correction cycle covering time scales beyond that of Born--Markov models.
Namely, we observe distinct power law behavior of the channel infidelity
$\propto t^{2a}$: $a\lesssim 2$ in the ultrashort times $t<3/\omega_{\rm c}$
and $a\approx 1/2$ in the short-time range $3/\omega_{\rm c}<t<30/\omega_{\rm
c}$, where $\omega_{\rm c}$ is the cutoff angular frequency of the bath.
Importantly, the five-qubit quantum-error correction code suppresses all single
errors, including those arising from the ultrashort and short-time evolution,
which are peculiar to the exact evolution. Interestingly, we demonstrate the
breaking points of the five-qubit error correction code and the Born--Markov
models for repeated error correction when the repetition rate exceeds
$2\pi/\omega$ or the coupling strength $\kappa \gtrsim 0.1 \omega$, where
$\omega$ is the angular frequency of the qubit. Our results pave the way for
applying numerically exact open-quantum-system models for the studies of QECs
beyond simple error models.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Quantum memory assisted observable estimation</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Liubov A. Markovich, Attaallah Almasi, Sina Zeytinoğlu, Johannes Borregaard</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T10:34:25Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The estimation of many-qubit observables is an essential task of quantum
information processing. The generally applicable approach is to decompose the
observables into weighted sums of multi-qubit Pauli strings, i.e., tensor
products of single-qubit Pauli matrices, which can readily be measured with
single qubit rotations. The accumulation of shot noise in this approach,
however, severely limits the achievable precision for a finite number of
measurements. We introduce a novel method, called Coherent Pauli Summation
(CPS) that circumvents this limitation by exploiting access to a single-qubit
quantum memory in which measurement information can be stored and accumulated.
Our algorithm offers a reduction in the required number of measurements, for a
given precision that scales linearly with the number of Pauli strings of the
decomposed observable. Our work demonstrates how a single long-coherence qubit
memory can assist the operation of noisy many-qubit quantum devices in a
cardinal task.

  <h1 style='font-size:40px;'>Identification of acoustically induced spin resonances of Si vacancy
  centers in 4H-SiC</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By T. Vasselon, A. Hernández-Mínguez, M. Hollenbach, G. V. Astakhov, P. V. Santos</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T10:27:38Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Silicon vacancies ($\mathrm{V_{Si}}$) in the 4H polytype of SiC form color
centers with long-lived and optically addressable spin states, which make them
promising spin qubits for quantum communication and sensing. These centers can
be created both in the cubic ($V2$) and in the hexagonal ($V1$) local
crystallographic environments of the 4H-SiC host. While the $V2$ center can be
efficiently manipulated by optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) even at
room temperature, ODMR control of the $V1$ centers could so far only been
achieved at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we show that magnetic resonance
induced by the dynamic strain of a surface acoustic wave can overcome this
limitation and enable the efficient manipulation of $V1$ centers up to room
temperatures. Based on the width and temperature dependence of the acoustically
induced spin resonances, we attribute them to spin transitions between the
$+3/2$ and $-1/2$ spin sublevels of the excited state of the $V1$ centers.
These results are an important step towards on-chip quantum information
processing based on $\mathrm{V_{Si}}$ centers driven by acoustic fields.

  diamond via Pressure Tuning</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Kin On Ho, Man Yin Leung, P. Reddy, Jianyu Xie, King Cho Wong, Yaxin Jiang, Wei Zhang, King Yau Yip, Wai Kuen Leung, Yiu Yung Pang, King Yiu Yu, Swee K. Goh, M. W. Doherty, Sen Yang</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T07:12:51Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  Understanding the profile of a qubit's wavefunction is key to its quantum
applications. Unlike conducting systems, where a scanning tunneling microscope
can be used to probe the electron distribution, there is no direct method for
solid-state-defect based qubits in wide-bandgap semiconductors. In this work,
we use pressure as a tuning method and a nuclear spin as an atomic scale probe
to monitor the hyperfine structure of negatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV)
centers in diamonds under pressure. We present a detailed study on the
nearest-neighbor $^{13}C$ hyperfine splitting in the optically detected
magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectrum of NV centers at different pressures. By
examining the $^{13}C$ hyperfine interaction upon pressurizing, we show that
the NV hyperfine parameters have prominent changes, resulting in an increase in
the NV electron spin density and rehybridization from $sp^3$ to $sp^2$ bonds.
The $ab$ $initio$ calculations of strain dependence of the NV center's
hyperfine levels are done independently. The theoretical results qualitatively
agree well with experimental data without introducing any fitting parameters.
Furthermore, this method can be adopted to probe the evolution of wavefunction
in other defect systems. This potential capability could play an important role
in developing magnetometry and quantum information processing using the defect
centers.

  polarization states in fiber channels</h1>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'><i>By Yiwen Liu</i></p>
  <p style='color:gray;font-size:30px;'>Published: 2022-12-15T06:14:01Z</p>
    <p style='font-size:30px;'>  The construction of quantum networks requires long-distance teleportation of
multi-qubit entangled states. Here, we investigate the entanglement dynamics of
GHZ and W states in fiber channels. In a fiber channel, the two most important
phenomena that affect polarization entanglement are polarization mode
dispersion (PMD) and polarization-dependent loss (PDL). We theoretically
characterize how PMD and PDL vectors affect three-qubit states. In particular,
upon quantifying the entanglement at the output states using concurrence and
entanglement witness, we reveal the occurrence of entanglement sudden death
(ESD) and the appearance of decoherence-free subspaces (DSFs) in tripartite
systems. Finally, we explore the evolution of GHZ and W state with an arbitrary
number of photons in a fiber network and evaluate the expectation value of the
entanglement witness.
